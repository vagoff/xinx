{h1 XinX}

{p TL;DR: {b XinX} is just {http://clojure.org/ Clojure} done right: using "fail fast" principle and abstracting from underlying platform. }

{comment
[!] {p
All values in XinX are immutable. There is no way to alter, say, for procedure to alter collection passed as its argument in course of its execution.}

{h4 Lexical Notes}
{pre
    line comments: ;; ... to the end of line
    block comments: (comment ... anything lexically well formed ... )
    ignore next form: #_0 #_"a" #_[1 2 3] #_(let a 1 :in (printf "a=%d" 1))
    (block comments are not quite comments; they are made to comment out large blocks of code easier)

{p There are two kinds of variables in XinX: mutable and immutable. All XinX values are immutable,
but variables are not values: one cannot store them in collection or get an indirect access to them.
By convention, mutable variables named as *somename* while immutable variables named as %somename%.
(By the way, constants are named as %somename%)
So,
}
{code
    (let
        n '*myvar*
    :in
        (assign n "hello") ;; -- WONT WORK!
    )
}
{p The difference between mutable and immutable variables exactly that immutable variables cannot be
(assign)-ed, only initialized in (using) and accessed in read only mode just by name.}
